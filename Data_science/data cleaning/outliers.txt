Outliers are extreme values that fall a long way outside of other observations.
Outliers are those values which are very different from most of the values. 
ie. There is column called "Age" for B.tech collge where students generally have age around 17 to 24
But if there is student having age of 50 then that will be consider as outliers

##Bad for Building Predictive Models

Because these outliers can induce the state of confusion in the predictive models, which in turn make the model very weak for making decision rules.
Then there is high chances that model will not perform good.

##Reasons for having outliers
-Data entry errors
-Measurement errors
-Experimental errors
-Natural errors

In process of producing, collecting, processing and analyzing data, outliers can come from many sources and hide in any dimension.

##Conclusion
Removal or treatement of outliers from the data of building a predictive model is very important as many machine learning algorithms are very sensitive to the range of distribution of attribute values in the input data.

Outliers in input data can skew and mislead the training process of machine learning algorithms resulting in longer training times, less accurate model and ultimately a porrer results.

##Types of outliers
1.Univariate Outliers: Are the points which are beyond the normal values in a single variable. Outliers in a single variable are called univariate outliers

2.Bivariate Outliers: Are those the points which lie far from the expected values when two variables are plotted against each other.
