problems instead of using tradinational or sophisticated ways of solving that perticular problem problems.

Mode :

-Having some missing values in a categorial variable called 'Gender'.
-Two type of values: Male and Female.
-To compute or replace the missing values from such a column we can use the "Mode function".
-It return the maximum occuring value. Which in turn can be used to replace the Misiing values.

Median :
-We should impute the missing values in numerical variables using the "Median Function" if there are outliers in the data.
-As the median function not sensitive towards outliers.

Mean :
-We should impute the missing values in numerical variables using the "Mean Function" when data doesn't contain outliers.
-As the median function very sensitive towards outliers.
