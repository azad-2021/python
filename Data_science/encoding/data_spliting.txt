we split our data into three parts
1.Train		2.Test		3.Validation

##Train data set is a sample of data which model learns

##The validation datset is a sample of data held back from training model that is used to give an estimate of model skill while tuning model's hyperparameters.

##The test dataset is the dataset on which the model makes the prediction after learning on training data.
