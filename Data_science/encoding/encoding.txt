Encoding data means converting categorical data into numerical data.
Types of Encoding Techniques

-Label Encoding
-Feature Encoding
-One Hot Encoding
-Binary Encoding
-BaseN Encoding
-Target Encoding

1.Label Encoding: Each category is assigned a value 1 through N
				  where N is the number of categories in the column
				  Example:
				  sate			label encoding
				  Goa			1
				  Gujrat		2
				  Punjab		3

2.Feature Mapping: Feature mapping is a function which maps a data vector to a feature space.
				   It is used in case of ordinal variables..
				   Example: Size			Feature Encoding

				   			Low				1
				   			High				3
				   			Medium				2

3.One Hot Encoding: We map each category to a vector that contains 1 or 0. The number of vectors depend upon the number of categories.
					Example:
					color				Red		Yellow		Green
					Red 				 1		  0			  0
					Red					 1		  0			  0
					Yellow				 0		  1			  0
					Green				 0		  0			  1


4.Binary Encodin: It converts a category into binary digits. Each binary digit creates one feature column.
If there are one unique categories, then binary encoding results log base2 to power n features.

5.BaseN Encoding: Generalising the value of N in log base N, we get BaseN encoding.
When our Base is 1, it is One Hot Encoding.
When the base is 2, It is binary Encoding.
If we want higher base, we can use BaseN Encoding, which can be used for columns where we have huge number of distinct values.

6.Target Encoding: Process of replacing a categorical value with any of the aggregation of the target variable.
					Example: Color		Target							Encoding		Target
							 Red		   1							  1.00			  1
							 Green		   0 							  0.5			  0
							 blue		   0  							  0.5			  0
							 Red		   1 							  1.00			  1
