Types of machine learning:

		1.Supervised Learning: supervised learning is a learning technique where we have input vgariables and an
		output varaibles and we use an algorithm to learn the mapping function from the input to the output.

		Supervised learning techniques are composed of complex algorithms and are divided into Classification and
		regression models.
		Classification models are used for problems where the output variables are "yes" or "No" or "Pass" or "Fail".

		Regressing model is used where the output variables is real value such as Number, price, pressure, weight etc. Some of the familier algorithms include linear regression, polynomial regression etc.

		2.Unsupervised learning: Unsupervised learning is where we only have input data and no corresponding output variables.
		The goal of unsupervised learning is to model the underlying structure or distribution in the data in
		order to learn more about data.

		In unsupervised learning technique, the model learns by inferences from datasets consisting of output data 
		without labelled responses.
		The most common unsupervised learning method is cluster analysis, which is used for exploratory data
		analysis to find hidden patterns or grouping in data.

Classification Models: In classification, the algorithms attempt to learn the properties of diffrernt categories
present in the dataset.

Regression Model: Regression algorithms attempt to estimate the mapping function from the input variables to numerical or continuous variables.
In this case, y is a real value, which can be an integer or a floating-point value.
Therefore, regression prediction problems are usually quantities or sizes.
For example, when provided with a dataset about houses, and we are asked about to predict their prices, that is a regression task because the price will be a continuous output.
